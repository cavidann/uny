                    Outdated teaching methods. Language courses focus on reading and writing instead of effective
                    communication. Memorising grammar rules and sentence structure from textbooks requires a lot of
                    repetition and starts to get boring. Scientists have proven long ago that boredom interferes with
                    the ability to memorise which makes learning even more difficult and, of course, boring.
                    Time and labour. An average language course is usually twice a week and lasts for around 1,5 hours.
                    6 semesters of such classes make up a total of 360 hours. Only 20% of the tutor's attention goes to
                    a single person. The remaining 80% goes to other students. Let’s not forget to mention that it’s
                    only classwork. Many more hours add up between that. Travel, homework (which doesn't teach to
                    understand or speak) and constant repetition.
                    <br>
                    Learning in a group. Students have to listen to each other’s mistakes and bad accents and form bad
                    speaking habits as a result. No wonder feeling ashamed and being afraid of making mistakes is so
                    common among novice learners. This lack of confidence in one’s speaking skills is often the cause of
                    giving up on learning altogether.

                <p class="uppercase wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s">MASSIVE expenses. One semester (only 5 months!) of such “learning” can cost from $500 to $1500 and
                    that’s not a one-off payment. To reach the level of proper communication, one needs at least 6
                    semesters $3000-$9000 of your income! More expenses pile up on textbooks and other required learning
                    materials.
                    These four points perfectly illustrate the harsh reality of taking language learning classes. The
                    odds of such a big investment (mental, physical and financial) bringing a desired outcome are so
                    small, that, honestly, it’s not worth the risk. Especially now, when you have technologies by your
                    side.</p>
